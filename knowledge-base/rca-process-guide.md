## Overview

This guide provides a structured approach to conducting Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for recurring support tickets in the Single Family Technology Services environment. The process follows industry best practices and Fannie Mae's incident management procedures.

## RCA Process Overview

### When to Conduct RCA

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Same issue occurs 3+ times within 30 days
- Critical or high-severity incidents
- Issues affecting multiple users/systems
- Management escalation requests
- Customer impact threshold exceeded

**RCA Timeline:**
- **Immediate:** Within 24 hours of incident resolution
- **Preliminary Report:** Within 48 hours
- **Final Report:** Within 5 business days
- **Action Items:** Within 10 business days

## RCA Methodology

### Phase 1: Incident Analysis

**1.1 Gather Incident Data**
```
Sources:
- ServiceNow ticket history
- System logs and monitoring data
- User reports and feedback
- Change management records
- Performance metrics

Tools:
- ServiceNow reporting
- Splunk log analysis
- APM tools (New Relic, Dynatrace)
- Network monitoring (SolarWinds)
```

**1.2 Identify Patterns**
```
Analysis Areas:
- Time patterns (hourly, daily, weekly)
- User patterns (specific users, roles, locations)
- System patterns (servers, applications, databases)
- Error patterns (error codes, messages, frequencies)
- Environmental patterns (network, infrastructure)
```

**1.3 Create Timeline**
```
Timeline Components:
- Initial detection time
- First user report
- Escalation points
- Resolution attempts
- Final resolution
- Post-resolution monitoring
```

### Phase 2: Root Cause Identification

**2.1 5-Why Analysis**
```
Example: API Gateway 500 Errors
1. Why did the API return 500 errors?
   → Backend service was unavailable

2. Why was the backend service unavailable?
   → Database connection pool was exhausted

3. Why was the connection pool exhausted?
   → Long-running queries were blocking connections

4. Why were queries running long?
   → Missing database index on loan_id column

5. Why was the index missing?
   → Database schema wasn't updated after recent deployment
```

**2.2 Fishbone Diagram**
```
Categories to Analyze:
- People (training, procedures, communication)
- Process (workflows, approvals, monitoring)
- Technology (hardware, software, configuration)
- Environment (network, infrastructure, external factors)
- Materials (data, files, configurations)
- Methods (procedures, standards, practices)
```

**2.3 Technical Deep Dive**
```
Investigation Areas:
- Code analysis and review
- Configuration validation
- Performance profiling
- Security assessment
- Dependency analysis
- Integration testing
```

### Phase 3: Solution Development

**3.1 Immediate Actions (Workarounds)**
```
Types of Workarounds:
- Manual processes to bypass issue
- Configuration changes to reduce impact
- Monitoring enhancements for early detection
- User communication and training
- Temporary system restrictions
```

**3.2 Long-term Solutions**
```
Solution Categories:
- Code fixes and improvements
- Infrastructure changes
- Process improvements
- Training and documentation
- Monitoring and alerting enhancements
- Preventive measures
```

**3.3 Risk Assessment**
```
Risk Factors:
- Implementation complexity
- Business impact of changes
- Resource requirements
- Timeline constraints
- Rollback procedures
- Testing requirements
```

```

## RCA Best Practices

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Include relevant screenshots and logs
- Reference specific ticket numbers and timestamps
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Include success metrics and review dates

### Stakeholder Communication
- Regular updates during investigation
- Clear escalation procedures
- Executive summary for management
- Technical details for implementation teams
- User communication for impact

### Continuous Improvement
- Review RCA process effectiveness
- Update templates and procedures
- Share lessons learned across teams
- Track implementation success rates
- Regular training and knowledge sharing

## Common RCA Scenarios

### API Gateway Issues
```
Common Causes:
- Backend service failures
- Rate limiting configuration
- Authentication service problems
- Network connectivity issues
- Load balancer misconfigurations
```

### Database Performance
```
Common Causes:
- Missing or inefficient indexes
- Long-running queries
- Connection pool exhaustion
- Resource constraints
- Schema design issues
```

### File Transfer Problems
```
Common Causes:
- Firewall configuration changes
- Network connectivity issues
- Authentication problems
- File size or format restrictions
- Server capacity limitations
```

## Escalation Procedures

**Level 1:** ServiceNow ticket creation and initial analysis  
**Level 2:** Technical team involvement and detailed investigation  
**Level 3:** Management escalation and cross-team coordination  
**Level 4:** Executive escalation and business impact assessment
